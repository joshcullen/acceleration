R code associated w/ Cullen et al. paper on the estimation of behavioral states and habitat associations in giant armadillos using acceleration and GPS data.

This repository stores the R scripts used to process and analyze data, visualize the results, and generate figures. However, the giant armadillo data is archived on [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study887500396) and is available upon request. Additionally, the land use/land cover raster layers are also available in this repository.
